# Udacity - Programming Foundations with Python
This repo contains the **Movie Trailer Website** project inside the `project/` directory. Here are the instructions to get the project up and running on your machine.

## Prerequisites:
* Python 2.7

## Steps:
Execute the following commands in your terminal:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/air-walk/udacity-programming-foundations-with-python.git
cd udacity-programming-foundations-with-python/project
python entertainment_center.py
```
The last command in the snippet above will generate a file called `fresh_tomatoes.html` and open it in your default browser. I've also committed this output file in the `project/output/` directory of this repo for reference.
